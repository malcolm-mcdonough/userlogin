# UserLogin, Cryptography CTF
A NoSql user login, where I encrypt, hash, and use my own encoding to secure login data! Enjoy trying to crack the data within the nosql file!

In the main folder there will be a text file with encryped admin lgoin data. Use the login script to help you crack the data and you will have the credentialls to login to my site(https://myschoolctf.herokuapp.com/), that was only made with python and html, and store your name in history!
